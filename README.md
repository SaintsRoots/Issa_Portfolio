# Issa Portfolio Backend

## Description

The backend for Issa Portfolio is designed to efficiently manage and serve data to the frontend of the portfolio website. Built with Node.js and leveraging MongoDB for database operations, it provides a robust API for CRUD operations, user authentication, and other server-side logic essential for the portfolio's functionality.

## Features

- **RESTful API:** Implements RESTful design principles for clear and effective communication between the frontend and backend.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for managing access and session control.
- **CRUD Operations:** Comprehensive endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) portfolio projects and other content.
- **Data Validation:** Implements data validation to ensure integrity and quality of the data stored in MongoDB.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms for a reliable API.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding with the setup:
- Node.js (version 14.x or later recommended)
- MongoDB (version 4.x or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/muhozajohn/Issa_Portfolio
cd projectname-backend

2. **Install dependencies:**

npm install
# or if you use yarn
yarn install

3. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following (update values according to your setup):

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdatabasename
JWT_SECRET=yourjwtsecret
PORT=4000

## Running the Application

- **To start the server in development mode:**

npm run start:dev
# or using yarn
yarn dev

- **For production:**

npm start
# or
yarn start

The server will start running on the specified port, and you can make API requests to `http://localhost:8000` (or another port if you configured it differently).
